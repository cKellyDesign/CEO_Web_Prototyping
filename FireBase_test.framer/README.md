## Framer-Firebase Prototype
This is a Framer project using [Marc Krenn's Framer-Firebase module](https://github.com/marckrenn/framer-Firebase) and can be opened in Framer Studio. However, for better local debugging I like to host this directory via [Python's simple HTTP server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html).

This project is also hosted on Framer's cloud at https://framer.cloud/srAMZ
